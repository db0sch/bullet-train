For some reasons, I started studying japanese about a month ago.
And in order to keep working on it, and re-read the notes I'm taking in class,
I've decided to write this blog, and to try to explain to other people what I learned.
We all know that trying to teach someone something is a very good way to learn it yourself.
So I decided to do that. Let's see if it helps.

First things first, my japanese class is based on this book:

![Nihongo Fun & Easy book cover](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51r%2BzxlSnSL.jpg "Nihongo Fun & Easy")

[Nihongo Fun & Easy](http://www.funjapanese.net/funeasy/)

It's available on Amazon, and probably in any bookshop that sells English written language learning books.

There will be also some scans of documents that I got from class.

I'll also try to share some tips (like apps, movies, ... etc) that helps me with learning japanes.

If you have any question or remarks, please email me [dimitribosch@gmail.com](mailto:dimitribosch@gmail.com)

Have fun!
