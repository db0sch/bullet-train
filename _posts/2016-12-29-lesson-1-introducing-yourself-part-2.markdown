>O-shigoto **wa**?.

=> _(What is) your job?_

### Note
* `____ wa?` => abbreviation of a question
* by doing this, you only state the topic. You can do this when it's obvious you are asking a question (regarding the context)
* Rising intonation at the end `___ wa?` [⬆️]

### Example
Tanaka:
>O-shigoto **wa (nan desu ka?)**?.

Jon:
>Enjinia desu.

Tanaka:
>O-sumai **wa (doko desu ka?)**?.

("O-sumai" => home / place of residence)

Jon:
>Chiba desu.


### Some vocabulary
* `(O)shigoto` => _job_ (adding O at the beginning makes the noun polite. Use for other's, never for you)
* `(O)kuni` => _country_
* `(Go)shusshin` => _birthplace_
* `(O)namae` => _name_
* `(O)sumai / (O)uchi` => _home / place of residence_
* `(O)tsutome / kaisha` => _company_

(adding `O` or `Go` at the beginning makes the noun polite. Use for other's, never for you)

All these words can fit into the sentence:
> (O)namae **wa**?

### Example
Suzuki:
> Jon-san, o-kuni wa?.

Jon:
> Amerika desu.
